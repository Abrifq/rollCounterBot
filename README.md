- Rolling a specific number on a specific dice:
   `<prefix> <desired number> d<dice side count>`
  or
  `<prefix> d<dice side count> <desired number>`

  Rolls the `dice side count` sided dice multiple times per second and tries to get `desired number`,

  unless, it's impossible to roll that number. (For example: rolling a 100 on d20.)

- Rolling `<number>` on `<number>` sided dice:
  `<prefix> <desired number>`
  Rolls  the `<number> ` sided dice until it gets the max number,
  unless it's impossible to have desired dice. (For example: trying to roll a d1 or a d(-1))
